#wsdot-cordova-mobileapp

The `www` directories need to contain the `MobileApp` directory and files which are created
when you build the [WSDOT mobile app](https://github.com/WSDOT/wsdot-mobile-app).

You can build the app for iOS or Android with the following commands,

```
cordova build ios
cordova build android
```
